# Welcome to My Notebook

Hi, I'm Zack. I'm a Master's student trying to navigate the fascinating and often confusing world of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. This blog is my personal notebookâ€”a place where I document my learnings, share my "aha!" moments, and reflect on my experiences as a student living abroad in Heidelberg, Germany.

Here, you'll find a mix of technical deep dives and personal reflections. It's a chronicle of my journey trying to understand complex algorithms, wrestling with code, and finding balance and perspective through new experiences.

## Beyond the Screen: Life in Heidelberg

This is where I write about life outside the library. It's about finding my footing in a new country, the challenges and joys of being a student abroad, and the adventures that have kept me sane.
