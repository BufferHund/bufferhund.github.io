## About Me

👋 Welcome to **Zhaokun's Space** — a corner of the web where I explore the intersections of technology, design, and language.

I'm a passionate full-stack developer and computational linguistics enthusiast with a love for building elegant, scalable systems from scratch. My academic journey is rooted in computer science and AI-assisted software engineering, with a focus on how natural language technologies can enhance developer productivity and digital user experiences.

My work spans modern web architectures, workflow automation, and enterprise-level software engineering. I enjoy crafting intuitive interfaces, optimizing backend performance, and designing tools that empower users. Whether it's a full-stack application, a conversational AI, or a front-end refactor, I aim for clean, modular, and maintainable code.
