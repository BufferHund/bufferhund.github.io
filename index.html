        <h1 id="Seeing-My-Coursework-Everywhere-An-AI-Student’s-Look-at-Web-Development"><a href="#Seeing-My-Coursework-Everywhere-An-AI-Student’s-Look-at-Web-Development" class="headerlink" title="Seeing My Coursework Everywhere: An AI Student’s Look at Web Development"></a>Seeing My Coursework Everywhere: An AI Student’s Look at Web Development</h1><p>I have a friend who’s a frontend developer, and our conversations lately have been fascinating. I’ll be explaining a concept from my NLP class, like attention mechanisms or in-context learning, and he’ll stop me and say, “Wait, that’s exactly what’s behind this new tool I’m using.” It’s becoming clear that the world of web development is no longer separate from the world of AI; they’re actively merging, and it’s amazing to see from my perspective as an AI student.</p>
<h2 id="The-AI-You-Can-See-Smarter-More-Personal-Interfaces"><a href="#The-AI-You-Can-See-Smarter-More-Personal-Interfaces" class="headerlink" title="The AI You Can See: Smarter, More Personal Interfaces"></a>The AI You Can See: Smarter, More Personal Interfaces</h2><p>The most obvious changes are the ones we all experience as users. The “personalized recommendations” on every streaming service and e-commerce site are a direct application of the deep learning models we study for prediction tasks.</p>
<p>But for me, the most interesting part is the rise of truly useful conversational interfaces. For years, chatbots were clunky, rule-based systems that were more frustrating than helpful. Now, thanks to the same kind of large language models I’m learning to fine-tune, they can handle complex customer service queries, guide users through websites, and even understand intent with surprising accuracy. It’s applied NLP in its most direct form.</p>
<h2 id="The-AI-Behind-the-Screen-A-Superpowered-Developer"><a href="#The-AI-Behind-the-Screen-A-Superpowered-Developer" class="headerlink" title="The AI Behind the Screen: A Superpowered Developer"></a>The AI Behind the Screen: A Superpowered Developer</h2><p>What’s even more revolutionary, from my friend’s perspective, is how AI is changing the act of development itself. Tools like GitHub Copilot are essentially LLMs trained on a massive corpus of code. They’re not just doing simple autocompletion; they’re generating entire functions from a comment, suggesting bug fixes, and acting as a tireless pair programmer.</p>
<p>In my AI classes, we talk about the power of sequence-to-sequence models. Seeing that same technology write React components is a powerful demonstration of its versatility. It also brings up fascinating questions we debate in seminars about code ownership, quality, and the potential for AI to perpetuate subtle bugs or biases it learned from its training data.</p>
<h2 id="The-“Invisible”-AI-Optimization-and-Accessibility"><a href="#The-“Invisible”-AI-Optimization-and-Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="The “Invisible” AI: Optimization and Accessibility"></a>The “Invisible” AI: Optimization and Accessibility</h2><p>Then there’s the layer of AI that’s completely invisible to most users but is critical for a good experience. AI models are now being used to automatically audit websites for accessibility issues, like generating alt-text for images (a classic image captioning task) or checking for proper color contrast.</p>
<p>On the backend, AI is being used for predictive analytics to anticipate traffic spikes and for performance optimization, figuring out the most efficient way to load resources for each user. It’s the quiet, data-driven work that makes modern web applications feel fast and reliable.</p>
<h2 id="The-Responsibility-on-Both-Sides"><a href="#The-Responsibility-on-Both-Sides" class="headerlink" title="The Responsibility on Both Sides"></a>The Responsibility on Both Sides</h2><p>Of course, this fusion isn’t without its challenges. The same models that provide helpful personalization can also create filter bubbles and raise serious data privacy concerns. The same code-generation tools that boost productivity could introduce security vulnerabilities if not used carefully. As a student in this field, it’s a constant reminder that the ethical considerations we discuss in class have immediate, real-world consequences when these models are deployed at scale.</p>
<p>Watching the web development world embrace AI has been like seeing my theoretical knowledge come to life. It’s a sign that the skills we’re building in our NLP and ML courses are becoming fundamental across all areas of technology. The future of the web is being written not just with JavaScript and CSS, but with transformers, embeddings, and a deep understanding of how to build intelligent systems responsibly.

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="From-“Does-It-Work-”-to-“Will-It-Break-”-My-Evolution-in-Software-Testing"><a href="#From-“Does-It-Work-”-to-“Will-It-Break-”-My-Evolution-in-Software-Testing" class="headerlink" title="From “Does It Work?” to “Will It Break?”: My Evolution in Software Testing"></a>From “Does It Work?” to “Will It Break?”: My Evolution in Software Testing</h1><p>If I’m being honest, for the first couple of years of my computer science degree, “testing” meant running my code, seeing if it worked, and if it didn’t, throwing <code>console.log</code> statements everywhere until it did. It wasn’t until I was put on a team for a major project that I realized how unsustainable that was. A feature I added would break something my teammate wrote, and we’d spend hours trying to figure out why.</p>
<p>This forced me to actually learn about software testing. It started as a chore, but it quickly became one of the most valuable skills I’ve developed. I learned to think not just about the “happy path,” but about all the weird ways things could go wrong.</p>
<h2 id="The-Foundation-Unit-Tests"><a href="#The-Foundation-Unit-Tests" class="headerlink" title="The Foundation: Unit Tests"></a>The Foundation: Unit Tests</h2><p>This is where it all starts. Unit tests are small, fast tests that check a single, isolated piece of your code—usually a single function. At first, it felt tedious. Why write a test for a simple <code>capitalize</code> function when I can just see that it works?</p>
<p>The “aha!” moment came when I had to refactor a bunch of these utility functions. Without tests, I would have been terrified of breaking something. With a good suite of unit tests, I could make changes with confidence. I’d run the tests, and if they all passed, I knew my refactor didn’t break any existing functionality. We used Jest for this, and it was perfect for testing these small, pure functions.</p>
<h2 id="The-Next-Level-Integration-Tests"><a href="#The-Next-Level-Integration-Tests" class="headerlink" title="The Next Level: Integration Tests"></a>The Next Level: Integration Tests</h2><p>Unit tests are great, but they don’t tell you if your pieces work together. That’s where integration tests come in. For our React application, this meant using a tool like React Testing Library to test whole components.</p>
<p>Instead of just testing a single function, we were now testing a user’s interaction with a component. Can a user type in a form? When they click a button, does the right thing happen? We weren’t testing the implementation details; we were testing the component from the user’s perspective. This is where we caught the most bugs. A unit test might show that our API fetching function worked, but an integration test would show that our component failed to handle the error state from that API call.</p>
<h2 id="The-Top-of-the-Pyramid-End-to-End-E2E-Tests"><a href="#The-Top-of-the-Pyramid-End-to-End-E2E-Tests" class="headerlink" title="The Top of the Pyramid: End-to-End (E2E) Tests"></a>The Top of the Pyramid: End-to-End (E2E) Tests</h2><p>This was the final piece of the puzzle for me. End-to-end tests automate a real user’s journey through your entire application. We used Playwright to write scripts that would literally open a browser, navigate to our site, click buttons, fill out forms, and assert that the right things appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>These tests are slow and can be brittle, but they are incredibly powerful. They are the ultimate confidence booster. If the E2E tests pass, you know that a user can actually sign up, log in, and use the core features of your application. We set these up to run in our CI&#x2F;CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions) before any deployment. If an E2E test failed, the deployment was automatically blocked. It saved us from deploying broken code more times than I can count.</p>
<h2 id="Beyond-the-Pyramid-Other-Types-of-Testing"><a href="#Beyond-the-Pyramid-Other-Types-of-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Beyond the Pyramid: Other Types of Testing"></a>Beyond the Pyramid: Other Types of Testing</h2><p>We also dipped our toes into other types of testing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Regression Testing:</strong> We used Playwright to take screenshots of our key pages and compare them to previous versions. This caught a lot of embarrassing UI bugs where a CSS change would accidentally mess up the layout on another page.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Testing:</strong> We used <code>axe-core</code> to automatically check for common accessibility issues, like missing alt text or bad color contrast. It was a humbling experience that showed us how easy it is to build a site that’s unusable for some people if you’re not careful.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="My-Final-Takeaway"><a href="#My-Final-Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="My Final Takeaway"></a>My Final Takeaway</h2><p>Learning to test properly was a mindset shift. It’s not about proving your code works; it’s about trying your best to prove it <em>doesn’t</em>. It forces you to think about edge cases, error handling, and user behavior. It’s more work up front, but it pays for itself tenfold in the long run, especially when you’re working on a team. It’s the difference between building a house of cards and building something that can withstand a storm. </p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Grappling-with-LLM-Evaluation-A-Student’s-Field-Notes"><a href="#Grappling-with-LLM-Evaluation-A-Student’s-Field-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Grappling with LLM Evaluation: A Student’s Field Notes"></a>Grappling with LLM Evaluation: A Student’s Field Notes</h1><p>One of the biggest shifts for me moving from traditional NLP tasks to working with large language models has been evaluation. In my earlier coursework, evaluating a model was often straightforward—calculate the F1-score, check the accuracy, and you had a pretty clear idea of how well you were doing. But with generative models, how do you grade an essay, a poem, or a snippet of code? It’s a question my peers and I debate constantly.</p>
<h2 id="The-Old-Guard-BLEU-ROUGE-and-Their-Limits"><a href="#The-Old-Guard-BLEU-ROUGE-and-Their-Limits" class="headerlink" title="The Old Guard: BLEU, ROUGE, and Their Limits"></a>The Old Guard: BLEU, ROUGE, and Their Limits</h2><p>When you first start, everyone points you to the classic n-gram-based metrics: BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. They’re the old guard of text generation evaluation, born from the machine translation era. They work by comparing the overlap of words and phrases (n-grams) between the model’s output and a set of reference texts.</p>
<p>They’re useful for a quick “sanity check,” but we quickly learn their limitations. They can penalize creativity and semantic equivalence. If a model generates a perfectly valid and fluent sentence that just happens to use different words than the reference text, its score plummets. It’s a classic case of “hitting the target but missing the point.”</p>
<h2 id="Moving-Towards-Meaning-with-Semantic-Metrics"><a href="#Moving-Towards-Meaning-with-Semantic-Metrics" class="headerlink" title="Moving Towards Meaning with Semantic Metrics"></a>Moving Towards Meaning with Semantic Metrics</h2><p>This is where more modern metrics like BERTScore have been a huge step forward. Instead of just matching words, BERTScore uses contextual embeddings to see if the generated text and the reference text <em>mean</em> the same thing. This feels much more aligned with what we actually care about. When I’m fine-tuning a model for summarization, I care more that it captures the essence of the source text than whether it uses the exact same phrasing.</p>
<h2 id="The-Gold-Standard-Human-Evaluation"><a href="#The-Gold-Standard-Human-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="The Gold Standard: Human Evaluation"></a>The Gold Standard: Human Evaluation</h2><p>No matter how sophisticated our automated metrics get, the conversation in our lab always comes back to human evaluation. Is the output fluent? Is it relevant to the prompt? And crucially, is it faithful to the source material without hallucinating facts?</p>
<p>This is the gold standard, but it’s also a huge bottleneck. As a student, running large-scale human evaluations is often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Plus, human judgment is subjective. Getting consistent scores from different evaluators (good inter-annotator agreement) is a challenge in itself.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bigger-Picture-Is-the-Model-Safe-and-Reliable"><a href="#The-Bigger-Picture-Is-the-Model-Safe-and-Reliable" class="headerlink" title="The Bigger Picture: Is the Model Safe and Reliable?"></a>The Bigger Picture: Is the Model Safe and Reliable?</h2><p>Lately, our program has put a heavy emphasis on responsible AI, so our evaluations are expanding. We’re now looking at metrics for robustness and bias. How does the model perform when you give it a slightly weird or even adversarial input? Does it amplify harmful stereotypes? Tools like StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs provide benchmarks for measuring these social biases, and it’s becoming a standard part of our evaluation checklist. It’s a reminder that a “good” model isn’t just accurate; it’s also fair and safe.</p>
<p>For me, learning to evaluate LLMs has been a lesson in itself. There’s no single number that tells the whole story. A truly comprehensive evaluation is a mosaic, combining automated metrics for a quick read, human feedback for the ground truth, and rigorous testing for safety and bias. It’s one of the most challenging, but also one of the most important, parts of building models responsibly. </p>

    </h1>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="From-Monolith-to-Microservices-A-Student’s-Journey-with-Node-js"><a href="#From-Monolith-to-Microservices-A-Student’s-Journey-with-Node-js" class="headerlink" title="From Monolith to Microservices: A Student’s Journey with Node.js"></a>From Monolith to Microservices: A Student’s Journey with Node.js</h1><p>For my final software architecture course, we had to build a small e-commerce application. Like most students, I started by building a “monolith.” All my code—user authentication, product catalog, and order processing—was in a single Node.js Express application, connected to a single database. It worked, and it was simple to get started.</p>
<p>But then, the requirements started getting more complex. A change to the order processing logic could accidentally break the user login. The database schema became a tangled mess. Deploying a small fix required re-deploying the entire application. Our professor then introduced us to the concept of microservices, and we decided to refactor our monolith. It was a challenging but incredibly valuable experience.</p>
<h2 id="The-Big-Breakup-Deconstructing-the-Monolith"><a href="#The-Big-Breakup-Deconstructing-the-Monolith" class="headerlink" title="The Big Breakup: Deconstructing the Monolith"></a>The Big Breakup: Deconstructing the Monolith</h2><p>The first step was to identify the “bounded contexts” of our application. We broke our single application into three smaller, independent services:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User Service:</strong> Responsible for everything related to users: registration, login, profiles. It had its own database with just the <code>users</code> table.</li>
<li><strong>Product Service:</strong> Managed the product catalog. It had its own database with the <code>products</code> table.</li>
<li><strong>Order Service:</strong> Handled the shopping cart and order processing. It had its own database with the <code>orders</code> table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each service was a completely separate Node.js application. This was the core principle of microservices: independent deployment and a database per service.</p>
<h2 id="The-New-Boss-The-API-Gateway"><a href="#The-New-Boss-The-API-Gateway" class="headerlink" title="The New Boss: The API Gateway"></a>The New Boss: The API Gateway</h2><p>With our services separated, we immediately ran into a new problem: how does the frontend know which service to talk to? The solution was to introduce an <strong>API Gateway</strong>.</p>
<p>The API Gateway is a single entry point for all incoming requests. It acts like a traffic cop, routing requests to the appropriate service. A request to <code>/api/users</code> would go to the User Service, while a request to <code>/api/products</code> would go to the Product Service. This kept our frontend simple and decoupled it from the backend architecture.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-Services-Talk-to-Each-Other"><a href="#How-Do-Services-Talk-to-Each-Other" class="headerlink" title="How Do Services Talk to Each Other?"></a>How Do Services Talk to Each Other?</h2><p>This was the trickiest part. What happens when a new order is placed? The Order Service needs to tell the User Service to update the user’s order history.</p>
<p>Our first instinct was to have the Order Service make a direct API call to the User Service. But our professor warned us that this creates tight coupling. If the User Service is down, the Order Service can’t place an order.</p>
<p>The better solution was <strong>event-driven communication</strong>. We set up a simple event bus (using a library like RabbitMQ, though for our simple project, Node’s <code>EventEmitter</code> was enough to learn the concept). When the Order Service placed an order, it didn’t call the User Service directly. Instead, it published an <code>order.placed</code> event. Other services, like the User Service or a new Notification Service, could then <em>subscribe</em> to this event and react accordingly. This decoupled our services completely. They didn’t need to know about each other; they only needed to know about the events.</p>
<h2 id="Staying-Resilient-The-Circuit-Breaker"><a href="#Staying-Resilient-The-Circuit-Breaker" class="headerlink" title="Staying Resilient: The Circuit Breaker"></a>Staying Resilient: The Circuit Breaker</h2><p>What if our Product Service needed to call an external API to get shipping rates, and that external API was slow or down? We didn’t want our entire Product Service to fail because of a problem with a third-party service.</p>
<p>This is where we learned about the <strong>Circuit Breaker pattern</strong>. A circuit breaker wraps our external API calls. If it detects too many failures, it “opens the circuit” and immediately fails any new requests without even trying to call the slow API. After a timeout, it enters a “half-open” state to see if the external API has recovered. This prevented a single point of failure from cascading through our entire system.</p>
<h2 id="The-Lesson-Complexity-is-a-Trade-off"><a href="#The-Lesson-Complexity-is-a-Trade-off" class="headerlink" title="The Lesson: Complexity is a Trade-off"></a>The Lesson: Complexity is a Trade-off</h2><p>Moving from a monolith to microservices was a huge learning experience. It introduced a lot of new complexity: we had to manage multiple databases, set up an API Gateway, and think about inter-service communication. But the benefits were clear. Our services were smaller and easier to understand. We could deploy a fix to the Product Service without touching the User Service. And it forced us to think about resilience and fault tolerance in a way we never had to with our monolith.</p>
<p>For a student, it’s a powerful lesson in software design. It’s not about which architecture is “best,” but about understanding the trade-offs and choosing the right tool for the job. </p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Trying-to-Understand-MoE-How-LLMs-Get-Both-Bigger-and-Smarter"><a href="#Trying-to-Understand-MoE-How-LLMs-Get-Both-Bigger-and-Smarter" class="headerlink" title="Trying to Understand MoE: How LLMs Get Both Bigger and Smarter"></a>Trying to Understand MoE: How LLMs Get Both Bigger and Smarter</h1><p>Every few months, a new paper or model release sends a shockwave through the NLP community. Recently, it was all about models with “trillions of parameters.” My first reaction was, “How is that even possible?” The computational cost to run a dense model of that size would be astronomical. The answer, as I learned after a deep dive with my reading group, lies in a clever architecture called Mixture of Experts (MoE).</p>
<h2 id="The-“Committee-of-Specialists”-Analogy"><a href="#The-“Committee-of-Specialists”-Analogy" class="headerlink" title="The “Committee of Specialists” Analogy"></a>The “Committee of Specialists” Analogy</h2><p>The way I’ve come to understand MoE is by thinking of a standard, dense model as a single, general-purpose expert. Every single part of that model has to weigh in on every single token of input. It’s like having one person who is an expert on everything—history, physics, poetry, and programming—and forcing them to think through every single problem from scratch.</p>
<p>An MoE model, on the other hand, is like a committee of specialists. It has a number of “expert” subnetworks, each with its own specialty. When an input comes in (say, a piece of Python code), a “gating network” or “router” looks at the input and says, “This looks like a job for the programming expert and maybe the logic expert.” It then sends the input <em>only</em> to those relevant experts.</p>
<p>This is called sparse activation, and it’s the key to MoE’s efficiency. Instead of using the entire massive model for every calculation, you’re only using a small fraction of it. This allows you to build a model with a staggering number of total parameters, but with a computational cost that’s much, much lower.</p>
<h2 id="The-Good-and-the-Not-So-Easy"><a href="#The-Good-and-the-Not-So-Easy" class="headerlink" title="The Good and the Not-So-Easy"></a>The Good and the Not-So-Easy</h2><p>The benefits are obvious. You can scale your model’s knowledge capacity dramatically without a proportional increase in the compute needed for inference. This is how we get these incredibly powerful, frontier models.</p>
<p>However, as we discussed in my advanced ML course, training these models is a beast. There are a lot of new challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Load Balancing:</strong> What if the gating network gets lazy and keeps sending all the inputs to the same one or two “favorite” experts? The other experts would be undertrained and underutilized. Ensuring a balanced load across all the experts is a major engineering hurdle.</li>
<li><strong>Training Instability:</strong> These complex systems can be notoriously difficult to train. They require careful tuning of hyperparameters and can be a real headache to debug.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Is-It-the-Future"><a href="#Is-It-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Is It the Future?"></a>Is It the Future?</h2><p>From a student’s perspective, MoE feels like a glimpse into the future of model architecture. It’s a move away from the “bigger is always better” brute-force approach to a more elegant, efficient design. It’s a fascinating and complex topic, and while I won’t be training my own trillion-parameter MoE model anytime soon, understanding the principles behind it has given me a much clearer picture of where the field is heading. It’s a perfect example of how clever architectural design can be just as important as raw computational power. </p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Leveling-Up-in-React-My-Journey-with-Advanced-Hooks"><a href="#Leveling-Up-in-React-My-Journey-with-Advanced-Hooks" class="headerlink" title="Leveling Up in React: My Journey with Advanced Hooks"></a>Leveling Up in React: My Journey with Advanced Hooks</h1><p>For the first few months of learning React, I lived in a comfortable world defined by two hooks: <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>. They were my hammer and screwdriver, and I used them for everything. But as the application for my capstone project grew, I started hitting walls. My state logic became a tangled mess, components were re-rendering for no reason, and I was repeating the same patterns over and over.</p>
<p>This forced me to venture beyond the basics and into the world of “advanced” hooks. They seemed intimidating at first, but I soon realized they weren’t just complicated—they were solutions to the very problems I was facing.</p>
<h2 id="The-useState-Spaghetti-and-How-useReducer-Saved-Me"><a href="#The-useState-Spaghetti-and-How-useReducer-Saved-Me" class="headerlink" title="The useState Spaghetti and How useReducer Saved Me"></a>The <code>useState</code> Spaghetti and How <code>useReducer</code> Saved Me</h2><p>My first big problem was a complex form. I had a dozen <code>useState</code> calls to manage the form’s values, errors, and touched states. It was a nightmare to read and even worse to debug.</p>
<p>Then I discovered <code>useReducer</code>. I’d always associated it with Redux and complex state management, but it’s perfect for this exact scenario. Instead of a dozen <code>set</code> functions, I had one <code>dispatch</code> function and a single <code>reducer</code> that handled all the state transitions in a clean, predictable way.</p>
<figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Before: A mess of useStates</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> [name, setName] = <span class="title function_">useState</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;&#x27;</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> [email, setEmail] = <span class="title function_">useState</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;&#x27;</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> [nameError, setNameError] = <span class="title function_">useState</span>(<span class="literal">null</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> [emailError, setEmailError] = <span class="title function_">useState</span>(<span class="literal">null</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// After: Clean and predictable with useReducer</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> [formState, dispatch] = <span class="title function_">useReducer</span>(formReducer, initialState);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// dispatch(&#123; type: &#x27;SET_FIELD&#x27;, field: &#x27;name&#x27;, value: &#x27;Zack&#x27; &#125;);</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><strong>My takeaway:</strong> If you have a piece of state where the next value depends on the previous one, or if multiple state variables change together, <code>useReducer</code> will make your life infinitely better.</p>
<h2 id="My-App-Was-Slow-and-useMemo-useCallback-Were-the-Cure"><a href="#My-App-Was-Slow-and-useMemo-useCallback-Were-the-Cure" class="headerlink" title="My App Was Slow, and useMemo &amp; useCallback Were the Cure"></a>My App Was Slow, and <code>useMemo</code> &amp; <code>useCallback</code> Were the Cure</h2><p>I hit a point where a core component of my app felt sluggish. I’d type in one input, and the whole thing would lag. After some debugging, I realized that on every keystroke, a complex data-filtering function was running, and child components were re-rendering unnecessarily.</p>
<p>This led me to <code>useMemo</code> and <code>useCallback</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>useMemo</code></strong> became my tool for expensive calculations. I wrapped my filtering logic in <code>useMemo</code>, telling React to only re-run the calculation if the source data or the filter query actually changed. The lag disappeared instantly.</li>
<li><strong><code>useCallback</code></strong> was for function props. I was passing a handler function to a child component. Because the function was being redefined on every render, the child component thought it was getting a new prop every time and re-rendered. Wrapping the handler in <code>useCallback</code> ensured that the function reference stayed the same unless its own dependencies changed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My takeaway:</strong> These hooks are not for premature optimization. But when you have a real performance bottleneck, they are the precision tools you need to fix it.</p>
<h2 id="The-Magic-of-Custom-Hooks-Don’t-Repeat-Yourself"><a href="#The-Magic-of-Custom-Hooks-Don’t-Repeat-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="The Magic of Custom Hooks: Don’t Repeat Yourself"></a>The Magic of Custom Hooks: Don’t Repeat Yourself</h2><p>This was the biggest “level up” moment for me. I noticed I had the same data-fetching logic in three different components: a <code>useState</code> for data, one for loading state, and one for errors, all wrapped in a <code>useEffect</code>. It was classic copy-paste code.</p>
<p>The solution was to create my own hook: <code>useApi</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title function_">useApi</span>(<span class="params">url</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">const</span> [data, setData] = <span class="title function_">useState</span>(<span class="literal">null</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">const</span> [loading, setLoading] = <span class="title function_">useState</span>(<span class="literal">true</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">const</span> [error, setError] = <span class="title function_">useState</span>(<span class="literal">null</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="title function_">useEffect</span>(<span class="function">() =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// ... all my fetching, loading, and error logic</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;, [url]);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> &#123; data, loading, error &#125;;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Suddenly, in my components, all that complex logic was replaced by a single, beautiful line:</p>
<p><code>const &#123; data, loading, error &#125; = useApi(&#39;/api/users&#39;);</code></p>
<p>It was a revelation. I started seeing opportunities for custom hooks everywhere: <code>useDebounce</code> for search inputs, <code>useLocalStorage</code> for saving user settings, <code>useEventListener</code> for window events.</p>
<p><strong>My takeaway:</strong> Custom hooks are the single most powerful pattern in React for writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code. If you find yourself writing the same logic in multiple components, it’s probably time to create a custom hook.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moving beyond the basic hooks was a turning point. It taught me that React provides a complete toolkit for managing complexity. These advanced hooks aren’t just nice-to-haves; they are the key to writing professional, scalable React applications. </p>

        <h1 id="Building-My-First-RAG-System-Grounding-LLMs-in-Reality"><a href="#Building-My-First-RAG-System-Grounding-LLMs-in-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Building My First RAG System: Grounding LLMs in Reality"></a>Building My First RAG System: Grounding LLMs in Reality</h1><p>One of the first things you learn about large language models is their “knowledge cutoff.” Ask a model about an event that happened yesterday, and it will politely tell you it doesn’t have access to real-time information. For a project last semester, we were tasked with building a Q&amp;A bot about recent developments in our field, and this limitation was a huge roadblock. That’s when our professor introduced us to Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG—a technique that feels like giving a model a library card and a search engine.</p>
<h2 id="The-“Open-Book-Exam”-for-LLMs"><a href="#The-“Open-Book-Exam”-for-LLMs" class="headerlink" title="The “Open-Book Exam” for LLMs"></a>The “Open-Book Exam” for LLMs</h2><p>The concept behind RAG is surprisingly intuitive. Instead of relying solely on the static, pre-trained knowledge baked into the model, you give it the ability to look things up. It’s the difference between a closed-book and an open-book exam.</p>
<p>The process works in two main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Retrieve:</strong> First, when a query comes in, you don’t send it directly to the LLM. Instead, you use a “retriever” to search through a specific knowledge base—a collection of documents, articles, or even your own notes. This retriever finds the most relevant snippets of text.</li>
<li><strong>Generate:</strong> Then, you take the original query and the relevant documents you just found and feed them both into the LLM. The prompt essentially becomes: “Using the following information, please answer this question.”</li>
</ol>
<p>This simple, two-step process makes the model’s output more accurate, verifiable, and up-to-date.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-My-Hands-Dirty-The-Architecture"><a href="#Getting-My-Hands-Dirty-The-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Getting My Hands Dirty: The Architecture"></a>Getting My Hands Dirty: The Architecture</h2><p>When I built my first RAG pipeline, the retriever was the most critical piece. We used a dense retriever, which involves turning all our documents into numerical representations called vector embeddings. When a query comes in, we embed it too and then use vector search (we used a library called FAISS) to find the document vectors that are “closest” in meaning.</p>
<p>The magic is that this process can find semantically relevant information even if the keywords don’t match exactly. The generator part was more straightforward; we just had to format the prompt correctly to include the retrieved context.</p>
<h2 id="Why-This-Is-So-Exciting"><a href="#Why-This-Is-So-Exciting" class="headerlink" title="Why This Is So Exciting"></a>Why This Is So Exciting</h2><p>The applications for this are everywhere. Suddenly, you can build a chatbot for your company’s internal wiki, a tool that can answer questions about the latest research papers, or a system that can provide fact-checked summaries of news articles with citations. It directly tackles the hallucination problem by grounding the model’s response in a specific, verifiable source.</p>
<h2 id="The-Hard-Learned-Lessons"><a href="#The-Hard-Learned-Lessons" class="headerlink" title="The Hard-Learned Lessons"></a>The Hard-Learned Lessons</h2><p>Of course, it’s not plug-and-play. The biggest challenge I faced was what we called the “garbage in, garbage out” problem. If the retriever fails to find the right documents, the LLM has no chance of producing a good answer. Evaluating the performance of the retriever itself became just as important as evaluating the final generated text. There’s also a noticeable trade-off between the quality of the retrieval and the latency of the system.</p>
<p>For me, RAG represents a crucial step toward making LLMs more reliable and useful in the real world. It’s a practical solution that bridges the gap between the vast, static knowledge of a model and the dynamic, specific information we need to solve real problems. It’s definitely a technique I’ll be keeping in my toolkit for future projects. </p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="My-TypeScript-‘Aha-’-Moments-Best-Practices-I-Learned-on-a-Real-Project"><a href="#My-TypeScript-‘Aha-’-Moments-Best-Practices-I-Learned-on-a-Real-Project" class="headerlink" title="My TypeScript ‘Aha!’ Moments: Best Practices I Learned on a Real Project"></a>My TypeScript ‘Aha!’ Moments: Best Practices I Learned on a Real Project</h1><p>I just spent a semester wrestling with a pretty complex web application for my software engineering course. We chose TypeScript from the start, thinking it would magically prevent all bugs. It didn’t. But what it <em>did</em> do was force us to be better engineers. Along the way, I had a few “aha!” moments—things that, once they clicked, completely changed how I write code. Here are the big ones.</p>
<h2 id="Lesson-1-Your-tsconfig-json-is-Your-First-Line-of-Defense"><a href="#Lesson-1-Your-tsconfig-json-is-Your-First-Line-of-Defense" class="headerlink" title="Lesson 1: Your tsconfig.json is Your First Line of Defense"></a>Lesson 1: Your <code>tsconfig.json</code> is Your First Line of Defense</h2><p>When you first initialize a TypeScript project, you get a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file. My initial instinct was to ignore it. Big mistake. The single most important thing I learned was to enable <code>strict: true</code>.</p>
<p>Turning on strict mode is like activating a whole suite of safety checks. It forces you to handle <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> values, ensures your functions have explicit return types, and stops you from using <code>any</code> implicitly. It felt annoying at first, like the compiler was constantly yelling at me. But every error it caught was a potential runtime bug that would have been a nightmare to track down later. Don’t skip this. It’s your best friend.</p>
<h2 id="Lesson-2-any-is-a-Lie"><a href="#Lesson-2-any-is-a-Lie" class="headerlink" title="Lesson 2: any is a Lie"></a>Lesson 2: <code>any</code> is a Lie</h2><p>When you’re in a hurry, it’s so tempting to type something as <code>any</code>. It makes the compiler errors go away, and you can move on. I learned the hard way that <code>any</code> is a lie. It’s a backdoor that lets you escape the type system, which defeats the entire purpose of using TypeScript.</p>
<p>Every time we used <code>any</code>, it came back to bite us. We’d pass the wrong type of data, and the error would show up deep in some other part of the application, far from the source of the problem. The rule we eventually adopted was: if you don’t know the type, use <code>unknown</code>. <code>unknown</code> is the type-safe version of <code>any</code>. It forces you to do a type check before you can use the variable, which is exactly what you should be doing.</p>
<h2 id="Lesson-3-Use-interface-for-Shapes-type-for-Everything-Else"><a href="#Lesson-3-Use-interface-for-Shapes-type-for-Everything-Else" class="headerlink" title="Lesson 3: Use interface for Shapes, type for Everything Else"></a>Lesson 3: Use <code>interface</code> for Shapes, <code>type</code> for Everything Else</h2><p>The <code>interface</code> vs. <code>type</code> debate is endless online. Our team settled on a simple convention that made our code much easier to read:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use <code>interface</code> when defining the “shape” of an object.</strong> Think of it as a contract for what a <code>User</code> or a <code>Product</code> object should look like. Interfaces can also be extended, which is great for object-oriented patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Use <code>type</code> for everything else.</strong> This includes creating union types (<code>type Status = &#39;pending&#39; | &#39;success&#39;</code>), defining function signatures, or creating complex types using utility types.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple rule brought a lot of clarity to our codebase.</p>
<h2 id="Lesson-4-Utility-Types-Are-Pure-Magic"><a href="#Lesson-4-Utility-Types-Are-Pure-Magic" class="headerlink" title="Lesson 4: Utility Types Are Pure Magic"></a>Lesson 4: Utility Types Are Pure Magic</h2><p>This was my biggest “aha!” moment. I spent hours writing boilerplate types until a TA showed me TypeScript’s built-in utility types. They are incredible time-savers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to create a new type for a form that has all the properties of your <code>User</code> interface, but they should all be optional? That’s just <code>Partial&lt;User&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Need a type that only has the <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> from your <code>User</code>? That’s <code>Pick&lt;User, &#39;id&#39; | &#39;name&#39;&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Need a type that has everything <em>except</em> the <code>password</code>? <code>Omit&lt;User, &#39;password&#39;&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning to use these utility types felt like unlocking a superpower. It made our code more concise and much more maintainable.</p>
<h2 id="Lesson-5-Discriminated-Unions-for-State-Management"><a href="#Lesson-5-Discriminated-Unions-for-State-Management" class="headerlink" title="Lesson 5: Discriminated Unions for State Management"></a>Lesson 5: Discriminated Unions for State Management</h2><p>In our React components, we used to have a bunch of boolean flags to manage state: <code>isLoading</code>, <code>isError</code>, <code>isSuccess</code>. It was a mess.</p>
<p>The pattern that cleaned this up completely was discriminated unions. We created a state type like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">type</span> <span class="title class_">ComponentState</span>&lt;T&gt; = </span><br><span class="line">  | &#123; <span class="attr">status</span>: <span class="string">&#x27;loading&#x27;</span> &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  | &#123; <span class="attr">status</span>: <span class="string">&#x27;success&#x27;</span>; <span class="attr">data</span>: T &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  | &#123; <span class="attr">status</span>: <span class="string">&#x27;error&#x27;</span>; <span class="attr">error</span>: <span class="title class_">Error</span> &#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The <code>status</code> property is the “discriminant.” In our component, we could now use a simple <code>switch</code> statement on <code>state.status</code>. The best part is that TypeScript is smart enough to know that if <code>state.status</code> is <code>&#39;success&#39;</code>, then <code>state.data</code> must exist. It made our rendering logic clean, safe, and impossible to mess up.</p>
<hr>
<p>This project taught me that TypeScript isn’t about adding rules for the sake of it. It’s about providing a framework for writing code that is easier to reason about, maintain, and refactor. These practices were my lifelines, and I won’t be starting another project without them.</p>

All the features worked, the code was (mostly) clean, and I was proud of it. I sent the link to a few friends, and the first piece of feedback I got wasn’t about the features—it was, “Whoa, this takes a while to load.”</p>
<p>It was a classic student developer mistake. I had focused so much on making it <em>work</em> that I never stopped to think about making it <em>fast</em>. This sent me on a deep dive into the world of web performance optimization, and I discovered that it’s one of the most important aspects of user experience.</p>
<h2 id="Meeting-My-New-Bosses-The-Core-Web-Vitals"><a href="#Meeting-My-New-Bosses-The-Core-Web-Vitals" class="headerlink" title="Meeting My New Bosses: The Core Web Vitals"></a>Meeting My New Bosses: The Core Web Vitals</h2><p>My first stop was Google’s Core Web Vitals. I learned that these are the key metrics Google uses to measure the performance of a page, and they directly impact your SEO ranking. They became my report card.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</strong> How long does it take for the most important content on the page to load? My LCP was terrible. The culprit? A massive, unoptimized hero image I was using on the homepage.</li>
<li><strong>First Input Delay (FID):</strong> How long does the page take to respond when a user first tries to click or type something? My page would look loaded, but it would be frozen for a second or two.</li>
<li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong> Does the page content jump around as it loads? My page was a mess. Images would pop in and push text down, creating a jarring experience.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="My-Performance-Fix-It-List"><a href="#My-Performance-Fix-It-List" class="headerlink" title="My Performance Fix-It List"></a>My Performance Fix-It List</h2><p>With my “grades” in hand, I started tackling the problems one by one.</p>
<h3 id="Taming-the-LCP-The-Image-Diet"><a href="#Taming-the-LCP-The-Image-Diet" class="headerlink" title="Taming the LCP: The Image Diet"></a>Taming the LCP: The Image Diet</h3><p>That huge hero image was the first thing to go. I learned a few key techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next-Gen Formats:</strong> I converted my PNG to a WebP file, which cut the file size by more than half with almost no perceptible loss in quality.</li>
<li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> I added <code>loading=&quot;lazy&quot;</code> to all images that were below the fold. This tells the browser not to even bother downloading them until the user scrolls close to them.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Images:</strong> I used the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element to provide different-sized images for different screen sizes. There was no reason to send a massive desktop image to a mobile phone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Fighting-the-Freeze-JavaScript-on-a-Leash"><a href="#Fighting-the-Freeze-JavaScript-on-a-Leash" class="headerlink" title="Fighting the Freeze: JavaScript on a Leash"></a>Fighting the Freeze: JavaScript on a Leash</h3><p>My FID problem was caused by a massive JavaScript bundle. The browser had to download, parse, and execute all of my site’s JavaScript before it could respond to any user input. The solution was to give the browser less JavaScript to deal with at once.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Splitting:</strong> I configured my bundler (Webpack) to split my code into smaller chunks. The code for my homepage was in one chunk, the code for my contact page was in another, and so on. Now, the user only downloads the code they need for the page they’re on.</li>
<li><strong>Lazy Loading Components:</strong> In my React code, I started using <code>React.lazy()</code> to load components only when they were actually needed. The heavy chart library I was using on my dashboard page was no longer part of the initial bundle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Stabilizing-the-Page-The-End-of-Layout-Shifts"><a href="#Stabilizing-the-Page-The-End-of-Layout-Shifts" class="headerlink" title="Stabilizing the Page: The End of Layout Shifts"></a>Stabilizing the Page: The End of Layout Shifts</h3><p>Fixing the CLS was surprisingly straightforward but made a huge difference.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image Dimensions:</strong> The biggest win was simply adding <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes to all my <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags. This tells the browser the exact size of the image before it loads, so it can reserve the correct amount of space and the layout doesn’t jump when the image finally appears.</li>
<li><strong>Font Loading:</strong> I added <code>font-display: swap;</code> to my <code>@font-face</code> rules. This tells the browser to show a fallback font immediately and then swap in the custom font once it’s loaded. It might cause a quick flash of a different font style, but it’s much better than having the text be invisible or causing a massive layout shift.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-Lesson-Learned"><a href="#The-Lesson-Learned" class="headerlink" title="The Lesson Learned"></a>The Lesson Learned</h2><p>This whole experience taught me that performance isn’t a feature you add at the end; it’s a fundamental part of the design and development process. A fast, smooth website feels professional and shows respect for the user’s time. It’s a lesson I’ll carry with me to every project from now on. My portfolio doesn’t just work now—it works <em>well</em>.</p>
